In this project I am building a website for storm chasing group called TORCH chasing. This website serves as the one stop shop for all information related to TORCH and its chasing. With a WX center (in progress) a newsletter (also in progress) spc outlooks, divsions and departments, our team page, contact us, among other pages. Live link: https://torchchasing.org/ As stated previously, some key fetures currently include a WX center with warings feeds and spc outlooks, a contact us page for inquiries, pages for our divsions and departments, and a our team page. For this website i used HTML, CSS, and javaScript. HTML served as the front end programming for the webpage containing all information adn text bodies. CSS Would be frontend styling part of the project. For deployment I used GitHub pages. additional tools include VS code, and Node.js. Future improvements and or additions include a newsletter, expanded and enhanced WX center with live radar images and storm tracking, andlight/dark mode.
